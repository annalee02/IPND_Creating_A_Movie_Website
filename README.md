# Project Overview
For this project, I wrote code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Then I used my code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailer.

### Project Objectives
* To learn OOP through a series of mini-projects and exercises using a variety of Python libraries. 
* To practice how to programmatically send text messages, decode secret messages, and draw images with Python.

### File
* `entertainment_center.py`: importing `fresh_tomatoes.py` and `media.py` files and using list of movie instances as input
* `fresh_tomatoes.html`: the output file
* `fresh_tomatoes.py`: styles, scripting, layout, html template for the page. generating a `fresh_tomatoes.html` file and then opening it in the browser
* `media.py`: a class to enable other .py files to create instances and to use a pre-defined function
